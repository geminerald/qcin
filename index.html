        <h1>About</h1>
		<p>
			Sascha Scherff was born in Germany and has lived in several
			European countries before severe depressions and a major
			eczema outbreak forced him out of his corporate job and his
			marriage at the age of 35.
			He subsequently decided to “retire from corporate insanity”,
			booked a one-way ticket to Peru without any income or
			savings and learned how to earn an income online whilst
			backpacking across Latin America.
			Today Sascha’s mission is to financially empower individuals,
			especially young parents, helping them to quit corporate
			insanity, otherwise known as a 9-5 job, so children have the
			opportunity to grow up spending quality time with their
			parents. He believes that time is our most valuable asset and
			it should be spent doing what we love!
