					Sascha Scherff was born in Germany and has lived in several
					European countries before severe depressions and a major
					eczema outbreak forced him out of his corporate job and his
					marriage at the age of 35.
					He subsequently decided to “retire from corporate insanity”,
					booked a one-way ticket to Peru without any income or
					savings and learned how to earn an income online whilst
					backpacking across Latin America.
					Today Sascha’s mission is to financially empower individuals,
					especially young parents, helping them to quit corporate
					insanity, otherwise known as a 9-5 job, so children have the
					opportunity to grow up spending quality time with their
					parents. He believes that time is our most valuable asset and
					it should be spent doing what we love!
